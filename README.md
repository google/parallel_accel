# ParallelAccel library

ParallelAccel is a library for cloud-based distributed linear algebra operations (e.g., matmuls and various matrix decompositions) across multiple ASICs. This repository contains a simulator for performing at-scale matrix multiplication, tests, and many of the cloud infrastructure components. Not all of the modules will work out-of-the-box due to removal of some proprietary code. We hope that this repository will be inspirational and useful for the wider community of distributed computing.
